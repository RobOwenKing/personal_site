    <p>Below is a selection of my favourite coding projects, including in-browser toys and full web apps. Some were made during my coding bootcamp, others after or even before it. Click on any of them to try it out or head to <a href="https://github.com/RobOwenKing" target="_blank" class="link-dec">my GitHub page</a> to find the source code.</p>

      <p>After my bootcamp I wanted to make a full Rails app all by myself, and make something relevant to the unprecedent situation we are all facing. This was the result. Movida-19 allows users to post either requests for or offers of help then shows posts geocoded as being close to their address. There's also a messaging system so people can get in touch with each other.</p>

      <a href="https://www.goquedem.com/" ><h2>Quedem</h2></a>
      <p>This was my final project during my full-stack bootcamp. I was lead dev for my team, having pitched the idea for a way to make it easier to arrange meeting up with friends. It was a great chance to work with a variety of APIs and Ruby gems. We also got to experience working collaboratively at a distance as Spain went into lockdown.</p>

      <p>As a Maths student, most of the people you admire are dead as you're studying work generally from at least a century ago. John Horton Conway was one of the exceptions for me, a living mathematician I knew of and looked up to. He sadly passed away in April this year, so I decided to implement his classic Game of Life in Javascript, with a little added colour.</p>

      <p>What's the <abbr title="Hue, Saturation, Lightness">HSL</abbr> system? How does it relate to <abbr title="Red, Green, Blue">RGB</abbr>? In short, how do colours work in web browsers?</p>
      <p>There are two common ways of representing colour for use on the web: <abbr title="Red, Green, Blue">RGB</abbr> and <abbr title="Hue, Saturation, Lightness">HSL</abbr>. I had got my head around the former; I hadn't a clue about the latter. So I made this tool to see how it works and how the two systems relate to each other.</p>

      <a href="calculator_roman/calculator_roman.html" ><h2>Roman Numerals Calculator</h2></a>
      <p>What would it have been like if the ancient Romans had invented the first calculator? What's XII + IV? Or XDII - V?</p>
      <p>This was the last project I undertook getting back into coding before I decided to do the bootcamp. There are loads of apps to convert to or from Roman numerals, but it surprised me how hard it was to find a calculator to do sums entirely in that system. So I made one.</p>
